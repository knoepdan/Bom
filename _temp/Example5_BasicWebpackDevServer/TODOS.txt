Requirements: 
- React with Typescript support (react, typescript, webpack, ts-loader)
- good debugging (source maps.. by typescript)
- no unnecessary dependencies
- detect environment at runtime (development, production)
- inject configuration

- Development: 
--  hot reload  (webpack)

- Production
-- bundling and minification (webpack)



####################


- configuration depending on environment  (environment variables (production and dev))


for a new example: 
- add ts lint
- check what else do others have
- sass? maybe not needed as we react workflow has them working well
- testing  (unit and integration tests)
-- maybe not a very high priority right now
- react router
- react state management (probably last..as this is where im not sure)
