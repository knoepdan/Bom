## basic
npx create-react-app my-app --use-npm


## basic and typescript
npx create-react-app my-typeapp --typescript  --npm 



----------- probably the way to go because: 

- supported by react
- relativly easy 
- support for: 
-- live reload (check if hot-reload is possible)
-- environment variables
-- progressive webapps
-- eslint + prettier (probably out of the box.. to be checked)

To check: 
- hot reload possible
- what other dependencies do we have?
-- compare with other project.. sass? 
-- do simple projects work with both configurations: that should be the goal.. it should be just about the dev experience!!
