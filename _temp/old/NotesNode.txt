By far and away the biggest reason for using package.json to specify a project’s dependencies is portability. For example, when you clone someone else’s code, all you have to do is run npm i in the project root and npm will resolve and fetch all of the necessary packages for you to run the app. We’ll look at this in more detail later.

*************************************
most simple stuff:

node index.js  (will start index.js in node server)
npm start     (will start application according to package.json start script (one could also call npm test))
npm install   (triggers downloading packages from package.json .. and may be more)
npm ci   (is almost like npm install: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ci.html)

--------- exit 
ctrl c    (see also: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10522532/stop-node-js-program-from-command-line)
